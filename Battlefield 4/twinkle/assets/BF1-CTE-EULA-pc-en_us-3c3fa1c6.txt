ADDENDUM C 
BETA PROGRAM CODE OF CONDUCT
You agree:
1. That you are privileged guests on this system and as guests, we expect you to exhibit common courtesy to all EA personnel as well as other members of the Beta Program.  EA (“we” or “us”) will exhibit the same courtesy towards you.
2. You will be helping us shape the Game into a great product and we value your comments/insights/etc.  However, that is not a license to be rude, nasty, demanding or generally unreasonable to us or other Beta Participants.  People may have differing opinions about the game, and we ask that you respect those opinions. 
3. We need your feedback.  We appreciate your time and commitment in providing us with your opinions – we need them to make the program work!
4. When posting messages about the game in our private message boards or when sending email, please try to be as professional as possible.  Repeat the facts as accurately as you can and be constructive in both positive and negative feedback.  Saying things like “This game sucks” is not as helpful as pointing out specific problems the developers can address. You will never be banned, punished, taken to task, etc. for speaking your mind in an open, honest and professional manner.  Honest, well thought-out criticism is as valuable to us as are suggestions or praise.
5. Before posting messages publicly about the game outside the EA boards, please be sure you are adhering to the confidentiality terms of this Agreement and the instructions in Addendum A and Addendum B above.  Provided that you are expressly permitted to disclose the information as provided in Addendum A, we do not mind if you say things that are critical about the game, but remember that we still have a long way to go.  We do not expect you to be our cheerleaders, but neither do we expect you to trash the game just for the sake of trashing it.
6. If requested by EA personnel to help review an aspect of the game, please cooperate.  The sooner we work things out, the sooner the game goes LIVE.
7. Vulgar expressions, coarse language, abusive behavior, verbal harassment, or other behavior not in keeping with the spirit of our games will not be tolerated either towards EA personnel or other beta participants.  The use of such language, whether or not you consider it in-character, is not acceptable, whether you use it in casual and public speech, ‘private links,’ contacts or even in a character’s name.
8. As a beta participant, we ask you to report all problems, errors or bugs in the game to EA as soon as they are found.  Secretly abusing ‘bugs’, ‘undocumented features’ or other such things will not be tolerated, as these bugs can damage and delay the completion of this beta program. 
9. You will not represent yourself as an officer or employee, sub-contractor or as otherwise connected with EA, EA’s Licensors or the Game. 
10. You acknowledge and agree that your communications with other users, beta participants or EA via chats, conferences, bulletin boards, and any other avenues of communication within the Game or as part of this Beta Program are public and not private communications, and that you have no expectation of privacy concerning your use of this Game and participation in this Beta Program.  You acknowledge that personal information that you communicate within the Game or in connection with this Beta Program may be seen and used by others and result in unsolicited communications, therefore we strongly encourage you not to disclose any personal information about yourself in your public communications within the Game or the Beta Program.  EA is not responsible for information that you choose to communicate to other users within the Game or the Beta Program, or for the actions of other users.
11. In the event that a player has engaged in unacceptable behavior, EA will take appropriate steps to address the behavior.  EA in its sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate the player’s access to the Beta Program and/or the Game immediately and without further notice.
